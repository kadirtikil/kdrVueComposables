# useScramble

A Vue Composable for vue, leveraging it's reactivity!
Currently in development.

## Planned 
- Will contain all sorts of scrambles, and will be completely modular (no other packages necessary).
- Will be easily extendable by adding your own scrambles, leveraging Typescripts typesafety.
- Will have animations according to the type of scramble. 

Currently in development and not safe for production. Use at your own risk.
